# I really dig Oh My Zsh

## Here are some set-up notes

**Install via curl:**
`sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`

**Update ~/.zshrc config file**

### Powerlevel9k

I like the Powerlevel9k because it's easy enough to customize and get it to look the way I want. 

Just clone it into the `custom/themes` directory.

`git clone https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/powerlevel9k`

### Fonts

My favorite powerline font is **Meslo LG L DZ Regular** for Powerline, it can be found [here](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/Meslo%20Dotted).

### Awesome Terminal fonts

This font improves the symbols that are displayed in the terminal, particularly for git (i.e. an octocat, branch icon, up and down arrows, clock, etc). It's a bit of a pain to install but worth it I think.
